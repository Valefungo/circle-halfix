# circle-halfix
This is the adaptation of Halfix to run on bare metal Raspberry Pi

I always wanted to have a modern old computer, even an exceptional emulators as 86Box/PCem are don't give me the feeling to be running a real machine because of the ghost of Linux always looking from behind.
So this is my try to make up something that is an emulator and can run without Linux.

**Circle**: the awesome library that made this possible

**Circle-stdlib**: the companion of Circle that make the adaptation actually possible, without getting mad

**Halfix**: the most solid and understandable emulator I ever found, this shines on top of my personal preferences
